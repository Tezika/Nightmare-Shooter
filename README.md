# Nightmare-Shooter
##General

*Nightmare Shooter(NMS)* is a 2.5D rogue-like survival ðŸ”« game; It's models and scenes all come from the Unity official demo, *Survival Shooter*.  Now, there is a prototype level which contains three types of enemies and a boss.

## Features

### Different Enemies

Unlike the original project, in NMS, there are three types of enemies(**Hellephant, ZomBear, and Zom bunny**). Different enemy has different properties, like speed, attack point, and skills.

### Challenging Boss

In the prototype level, I design a challenging boss who has an aggressive AI. Despite its rough model -- which is combined by a couple of cubes or spheres,  it is difficult for players to beat down.

### Handy Items

In NMS, there are four types of items for the player to pick up and affect the player's performance, as the following list:

* **Green Cube**: Recover player some HP.
* **Blue Cube**: Increase player's move speed.
* **Yellow Cube**: decrease player's shooting cooldown.
* **Red Cube**: Increase player's shooting damage.



## Miscellaneous

As NMS is still in the prototype phase, in the future, I will do the following things to polish it:

* Refactor the whole codebase to map out it more clearly.
* Reconsider its level design and implement the custom procedure generation algorithm to generate every level randomly, which will help it literally become a "rouge-like" game.
* Refactor the player's control and make it support the joystick :joystick:
* Replace current art resources to new ones.
